# [Build a CMS With Laravel][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Laravel is a PHP framework for modern web apps. Recently upgraded to version 5, Laravel is a mature system that continues to win support due to its elegance and stability. Laravel ships with built-in support for database migrations, object-relational mapping, routing and authentication, making it easier for developers to start and maintain their work.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you how to build a complete content management system (CMS) with the Laravel PHP framework. You'll learn some of the tasks and problems that are common to so many web development projects, and you'll explore different possible solutions to them. You'll be starting your CMS from scratch—complete with page, user, and blog management capabilities. This is a great way to expand your knowledge of the Laravel framework!
